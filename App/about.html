                Welcome to Mount Prayer Chain!<br><br>

                My name is Chance White. I am a Student at Mount St. Mary's university obtaining
                a degree in computer science. This project spawned from an idea that I and the 
                University Chaplain had to give a platform to more students who are in need of prayers<br><br>

                There are 4 pages on this website. The <a class="link" href="home.html">home</a> page is where users can view prayers from others users.
                if you want, you can like some of the prayers and they will be sent to your profile page so you can
                save them and pray for their intentions. There is also the <a class="link" href="request.html">post a prayer</a> page where you, as a user can
                post your own prayer intention to your desired specifications. The <a class="link" href="profile.html">profile</a> page is where you can view intentions
                that you have post and delete some if you are desire and where you can view intentions that you have liked so you remember to pray for their intentions.
                The <a class="link" href="about.html">about</a> page is where you are now! It has all the information that you may need to naviagte this site. Enjoy!
                God Bless!<br><br>
